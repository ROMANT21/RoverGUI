# RoverCam

This repository is no longer being updated. It was moved to the Mission Control folder of the [Sooner Rover Team's Repo](https://github.com/bentonsmith8/SoonerRoverTeamV).

## Edit (12/28/22)

I lied. I did a little more development under the `python_v2` folder. Don't bother with `python` or `c++`.

To use the new stuff, you need opencv and zmq.

Install using:

```pip
pip install opencv-contrib-python pyzmq
```

Run the server and client, it doesn't matter which order.
